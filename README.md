# SeeFood: Fast Food Classifier Mobile App

SeeFood is a mobile app that uses the power of machine learning to classify up to six different types of fast food, including burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, hot dogs, tacos, and fries. With obesity and other health-related issues on the rise, it's becoming increasingly important to make informed decisions about the food we eat. SeeFood is a valuable tool for anyone looking to make healthier food choices, empowering users to take control of their health.
